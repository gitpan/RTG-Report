Install via CPAN:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install RTG::Report'

Or download the distribution from CPAN and build like any other perl module:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

Optional build targets are also supported:

  make test

If you are missing any of the required perl modules, you can run bin/install_deps.pl and it will install them for you via CPAN or FreeBSD ports.
